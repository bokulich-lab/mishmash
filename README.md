# MISHMASH

MIShMASh (MIcrobiome Sequence and Metadata Availability Standards) is a Python 3 package to download and evaluate sequence data and metadata associated with publications. It enables programmatic access to literature on PubMed Central and to data on the Sequence Read Archive (and other INSDC databases). Users can easily assess the openness of publication data and obtain said data for themselves.

## Installation
Use the package manager `pip` to install MISHMASH and its dependencies.

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/bokulich-lab/mishmash.git
```

## Usage
MIShMASh provides two main commands to scrape the content of PMC publications and fetch related metadata from the SRA.
 
```shell
scrape get_metadata \
  --email  \
  --accession_list  \
  --output_file
```
where:
- `email` is your email address (required by NCBI).
- `--accession_ids` is a space-separated list of accession IDs to retrieve metadata for. These can be BioProject, BioSample, BioExperiment, or likewise accession IDs that are used within INSDC interfaces e.g. the BioProject ID **PRJNA607574** for the [collection of samples uploaded by the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=(PRJNA607574)%20AND%20bioproject_sra[filter]%20NOT%20bioproject_gap[filter])
- `--output_file` specifies the output file to write the retrieved metadata to.

```shell
scrape get_accessions \
  --pmc_list  \
  --output_file
```
where:
- `--pmc_list` is space-separated list of PubMed Central IDs to search for associated INSDC accession IDs e.g. the PMC ID **PMC6240460** for [the 2017 article by Naymagon et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6240460/)
- `--output_file` specifies the output file to write the analysis to.
